# Banking System with React UI

Welcome to the Banking System project! This application integrates a C++ backend with a modern React frontend to manage banking operations. The project includes functionalities such as opening and closing accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, and displaying account details.

## Features

- **Open an Account**: Create a new bank account with an initial balance.
- **Close an Account**: Close an existing account.
- **Deposit**: Add funds to an account.
- **Withdrawal**: Withdraw funds from an account.
- **Show All Accounts**: List all accounts in the system.

## Architecture

- **C++ Backend**: Handles the core banking logic, including account management and transaction processing.
